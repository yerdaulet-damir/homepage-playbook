### 3-Step Checklist for an Effective Homepage

1. **One-Page Messaging Guide**  
   Consolidate “problem → solution → who it’s for → why it’s better” onto one page. Keeps the team aligned and speeds up copywriting.

2. **Simple Section Formula**  
   Hero → Social Proof → 2–3 Benefit Blocks → (Optional) Use Cases or Personas → How It Works → CTA Bar. A clear, uncluttered layout drives higher conversions.

3. **Proof Points in Every Block**  
   Support each benefit with data, screenshots, GIFs, or customer quotes. Real evidence builds trust and compels action.
